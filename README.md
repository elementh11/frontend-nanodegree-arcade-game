## Description

The arcade game is a project part of my Udacity FEND Nano Degree. It is a browser-based classic arcade game (also know as Frogger).

The project rubric is available here:
[ Arcade Game project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view).

## Instructions

To run the game: open the `index.html` file on your browser;

To play the game:

- use the left, right, up and down keys to move the player towards the water, avoiding the collisions with the enemies.
- for each complete run you receive 100 points.
- after each complete run, the difficulty increases: there are more enemies running at higher speeds.
- the goal is to beat your best score.

## Contributing

This clone project has 16 contributors: me and other people from Udacity, who provided the starter code.
